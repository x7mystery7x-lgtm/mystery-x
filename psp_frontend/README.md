# PSP Frontend (scaffold)

This folder contains a fresh Vite + React (JavaScript) scaffold tailored for the PSP project. Tailwind has been intentionally omitted — styles are authored in `src/styles/main.css` and component-level CSS files.

Quick start (run locally from `psp_frontend`):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The previous frontend was backed up to `psp_frontend_backup_20260127_120000` before this scaffold.
- Update assets in `public/` (logo files) and extend pages/components under `src/` to match the project overview.
